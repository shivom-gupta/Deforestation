# Deforestation

In this project, we have some data about the forest cover of various countries in two different years. Our goal is to do comparisions and find insights about what's
working to improve forest cover by taking into consideration the efforts put by countries whose areas increased drastically so that countries who couldn't perform that
well could learn about what steps they need to take to improve their forest cover and reduce deforestation.
