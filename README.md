# Global Deforestation Analysis (1990-2016)

### Overview

This project explores global deforestation trends from 1990 to 2016, using data from the World Bank. The analysis was conducted by ForestQuery, a mission-driven organization dedicated to combating deforestation and raising awareness of its environmental impact. The goal of this project is to identify areas of concern and success, providing insights into effective strategies for increasing forest cover and addressing the causes of deforestation.

### Dataset Description

The analysis uses data that includes:
- **Forest Area (sq km)**: The total forest area for each country by year.
- **Total Land Area (sq km)**: The total land area of each country.
- **Regions**: Geographic and income classifications for each country.

### Project Objectives

1. **Global Situation Overview:**
   - Assess the overall change in global forest area from 1990 to 2016.
   - Highlight the total loss in forest area during this period, emphasizing the global impact of deforestation.

2. **Regional Analysis:**
   - Compare forest cover across different regions of the world, identifying regions with the highest and lowest forestation levels.
   - Analyze the changes in forest area percentage by region from 1990 to 2016.

3. **Country-Level Insights:**
   - Identify countries with significant increases in forest area, focusing on success stories such as China and the United States.
   - Highlight countries with the largest absolute and percentage decreases in forest area, particularly in Latin America, the Caribbean, and Sub-Saharan Africa.

4. **Quartile Analysis:**
   - Group countries based on the percentage of land covered by forests in 2016, identifying those in the highest and lowest quartiles.
   - Examine the distribution of countries by forestation quartiles, focusing on those with exceptionally high forest cover.

5. **Recommendations:**
   - Provide actionable insights for countries experiencing deforestation, suggesting strategies based on the successes of countries with increasing forest cover.
   - Emphasize the need for sustainable development in regions facing severe deforestation, particularly in Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa.

### Key Findings

- **Global Forest Loss**: The world lost approximately 1.32 million square kilometers of forest area between 1990 and 2016, representing a 3.21% decrease.
- **Regional Disparities**: While most regions saw an increase in forest cover, Latin America & the Caribbean and Sub-Saharan Africa experienced significant declines.
- **Success Stories**: China showed the largest absolute increase in forest area, adding over 527,000 sq km of forest between 1990 and 2016.
- **Areas of Concern**: Brazil and Indonesia saw the largest decreases in forest area, with Brazil losing over 541,000 sq km. Togo experienced the largest percentage decrease, losing over 75% of its forest cover.

### Conclusion

The analysis reveals a mixed global picture, with both positive trends and significant areas of concern. Countries that have successfully increased their forest cover, such as China and the United States, provide valuable lessons for others. However, the significant losses in Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa highlight the need for targeted interventions and support for sustainable development practices.

### Recommendations

- **Sustainable Development**: Promote sustainable development practices in regions experiencing severe deforestation, especially in Latin America.
- **International Support**: Encourage richer nations and international organizations to provide financial and technical assistance to countries struggling with deforestation.
- **Research and Innovation**: Support research into the causes of deforestation, particularly in regions like North Africa where desert expansion is a concern, and develop innovative solutions to halt and reverse these trends.
